# Solution
Since we cannot use `*, /, and %` operators, we can use only `+ and -`. The basic process our solution is subtracting the `divisor` from the `dividend` until the the we cannot subtract anymore. But it takes too long if we just subtract, i.e., `dividend = INT_MAX; divisor = 1`, then we need to perform "subtracting" INT_MAX times. Before we dive into the performance-enhanced solution, let's check some special cases and basic settings:

+ Since `INT_MIN = -INT_MAX - 1`, we cannot convert `INT_MIN` to a positive integer. 
  + Hence we will fix our `dividend` and `divisor` sign as negative. Our loop will end when `dividend > divisor`.
  + And if `dividend == INT_MIN && divisor == -1` we return `INT_MAX`.
+ And if the `dividend == 0`, we return `0`.
+ The `quotient` will be negative only when one of the `dividend` or the `divisor` is negative while the other is positive.
  + We will check the signs for both `dividend` and `divisor` while storing the number of positive numbers and converting both to negative.

Now let's see the how we are going to develop our "subtracting" solution. (We assume both are negatives).

1. Think about we double the `divisor` until it is greater than the `dividend` and remember how many times we doubled.

   Example: 

   ~~~c++
   // dividend = -1003, divisor = -13
   // doubled = divisor, powerOfTwo = 1
   // doubled      powerOfTwo
   //   -13           1
   //   -26           2
   //   -52           4
   //   -104          8
   //   -208          16
   //   -416          32
   //   -832          64
   //   -1664         128 <-- dividend > doubled
   ~~~

   + Now we know that `divisor * 64 = -832` is the highest `divisor * 2^x` which can be subtracted from the `dividend`.
   + In this step, `doubled` could exceed the Integer boundary. Hence we should check whether the `divisor` is greater or equal to half of the INT_MIN before doubling it.

2. Then we subtract the highest doubled from the `dividend`, add the corresponding `powerOfTwo` to the `quotient`, and repeat the step 1 until `dividend > divisor`. But it is too inefficient that we find the highest doubled from the `divisor` since we already know the maximum boundary of the `doubled`. Hence, we find the new doubled by repeatedly dividing the previous highest doubled by 2 until the new doubled is greater or equal to the new `dividend`.

   Example:

   ~~~c++
   // dividend = -1003 - (-832) = -171, divisor = -13, quotient = 64
   // doubled      powerOfTwo
   //   -832          64
   //   -416          32
   //   -208          16
   //   -104          8 <-- dividend < doubled
   // So we repeat the step with dividend = -171 - (-104) = -67, divisor = -13, quotient = 72
   // doubled      powerOfTwo
   //   -104          8
   //   -52           4 <-- dividend < doubled
   // 
   // dividend = -67 - (-52) = -15, divisor = -13, quotient = 76
   // doubled      powerOfTwo
   //   -52          4
   //   -26          2
   //   -13          1 <-- dividend < doubled
   // At the end, we get dividend = -15 - (-13) = -2, quotient = 77
   ~~~

3. When we repeat the step of dividing the doubled by 2, we are going to use the ***right-shift*** operator since we cannot use the `/` operator. But in this process, we should check whether the `negative_number >> 1` works fine.

   ~~~c++
   #include <iostream>
   int main() {
       // We expect to get the same output, 501, from both (n1 >> 1) and (n2 >> 1)
       int n1 = -1003;
       int n2 = -1002;
       std::cout << "n1 >> 1 = " << (n1 >> 1) << ", n2 >> 1 = " << (n2>>1) <<std::endl;
   }
   // Output:
   // n1 >> 1 = -502, n2 >> 1 = -501
   ~~~

   As you can see above, `n >> 1` doesn't work as we want it to. To handle this issue, we just need to `(n + 1) >> 1`. Let's check

   ~~~c++
   #include <iostream>
   int main() {
       // We expect to get the same output, 501, from both (n1 >> 1) and (n2 >> 1)
       int n1 = -1003;
       int n2 = -1002;
       std::cout << "(n1 + 1) >> 1 = " << ((n1 + 1) >> 1) << ", (n2 + 1) >> 1 = " << ((n2 + 1)>>1) <<std::endl;
   }
   // Output:
   // (n1 + 1) >> 1 = -501, (n2 + 1) >> 1 = -501
   ~~~

Now let's see the implementation.

# C++ Code
```c++
class Solution {
    // To check whether the doubled + doubled >= INT_MIN
    int HALF_INT_MIN = -1073741824;
public:
    int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {
        // These are the basic settings
        if (dividend == INT_MIN && divisor == -1) return INT_MAX;
        if (divisor == 1) return dividend;
        if (divisor == -1) return -dividend;
        if (dividend == 0) return 0;

        int positives = 0;
        if (dividend > 0) {
            positives++;
            dividend = -dividend;
        }
        if (divisor > 0) {
            positives++;
            divisor = -divisor;
        }

        // The process below are the main process
        int doubled = divisor;
        int powerOfTwo = 1;

        // Find the first highest doubled and its powerOfTwo
        while (doubled >=HALF_INT_MIN && dividend <= doubled + doubled) {
            powerOfTwo += powerOfTwo;
            doubled += doubled;
        }

        // Now we repeat finding the highest doubled by dividing it by 2
        int quotient = 0;
        while (dividend <= divisor) {
            if (dividend <= doubled) {
                quotient += powerOfTwo;
                dividend -= doubled;
            }

            // dividing by 2 using bit manipulation.
            powerOfTwo >>= 1;
            doubled >>= 1;
        }

        return positives == 1 ? -quotient : quotient;
    }
};
```

~~~

# Time Complexity: *$O(log(n))$*
We loop over the bits of our dividend, performing an $O(1)$ operation each time. Hence the time complexity is just the number of bits of the dividend: $O(log(n))$.

# Space Complexity: *$O(1)$*
We only use a fixed number of int variables, so the space complexity is $O(1)$.
