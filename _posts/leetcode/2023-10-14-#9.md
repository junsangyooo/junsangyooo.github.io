This question is from the [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) and you can find the question here, [9. Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/).
{: .notice--danger}

# Solution
We can see that if $x$ is a negative integer, it cannot be a palindrome. And if the last digit of $x$ is $0$ and $x$ is not equal to zero, $x$ is not a palindrome since the greatest digit of any integer except $0$, cannot be $0$.

Think about some properties of palindrome integer, for example 3993. We can see that the first two digits and the reversed last two digits are identical. If the integer has an odd length, for example 12321, The left part of the middle digit and the reversed right part of the middle digit should be identical. Thus, we should divide the given integer as two parts that one part is in original position and the other part is reversed. Then we can determine that the integer is palindrome by comparing two parts.

# C++ Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(int x) {
        if (x < 0 || (x % 10 == 0 && x != 0)) return false;
        
        int reverse = 0;
        
        // If x == 12321, at the end of the loop below, x will be 12 and the reverse will be 123
        // If x == 3993, at the end of the loop below, x will be 39 and the reverse will be 39
        while (x > reverse) {
            reverse = reverse * 10 + x % 10;
            x /= 10;
        }
        
        // if x is an even length integer, x should be equal to the reverse.
        // otherwise, the x and reverse/ 10 should be equal.
        // For example, if the given integer is 12321, x = 12 and reverse/10 = 12.
        return x == reverse || x == reverse/10;
    }
};
```

# Python Code
~~~python
class Solution(object):
    def isPalindrome(self, x):
        """
        :type x: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if x < 0 or (x % 10 == 0 and x is not 0):
            return False

        reverse = 0
        while (x > reverse):
            reverse = reverse * 10 + x % 10
            x /= 10
        
        return x == reverse or x == reverse / 10

# Time Complexity: *$O(log_{10}(x))$*
We divided the input by 10 for every iteration, so the time complexity is $O(log_{10}(x))$.

# Space Complexity: *$O(1)$*
We only use one extra space to store the reverse.
