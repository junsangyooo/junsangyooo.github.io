This question is from the [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) and you can find the question here, [14. Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/).
{: .notice--danger}

# Solution
The **prefix** means the string comes front of the string. Hence the longest common prefix must appear at the front of all of the strings in the given array, `strs`.

We can find the longest common prefix by *vertical scanning*.  We iterate the first string in the array with the index, `i`,  and let `c` be the current character at the index. Then we iterate all the other strings to check whether the character of the other strings at the index of the `i` is equal to `c`. If so, `c` is in the common prefix. Otherwise, the substring(0, index) is the longest common prefix (This is because we assume that we already checked the characters that come before the index).

# C++ Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string longestCommonPrefix(vector<string>& strs) {
        if (strs.size() == 0) return "";
        for (int i = 0; i < strs[0].size(); i++) {	// Iterate the first string of the array
            char c = strs[0][i];
            for (int j = 1; j < strs.size(); j++) {
                if (i == strs[j].size() || strs[j][i] != c) return strs[0].substr(0, i);
            }
        }
        return strs[0];
    }
};
```

# Python Code
~~~python
class Solution(object):
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs):
        """
        :type strs: List[str]
        :rtype: str
        """
        if not strs: return ""
        
        for i, c in enumerate(strs[0]):
            for j in range(1, len(strs)):
                if i == len(strs[j]) or strs[j][i] != c: return strs[0][:i]
        return strs[0]
~~~

# Time Complexity: *$O(S)$*
Where $S$ is the sum of all characters in all strings. This is because, in the worst case that all strings, $n$, are same with the size of $m$, our program performs $S = m \times n$ character comparisons. 

# Space Complexity: *$O(1)$*
We only used constant extra space.
