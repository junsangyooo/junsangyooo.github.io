# What is Array?
An **array** is a collection of items of same data types stored at contiguous memory locations.
{: .notice}

These are three key-words need to know:
+ Array Index: In an array, elements are identified by their indexes (starts from 0).
+ Array Element: Elements are items stored in an array.
+ Array Length: The length of the array is determined by the maximum number of elements it can contain.

The Array looks like:

| Array | 3    | 6    | 10   | 15   |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Index | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    |

The array above has the length of 4 and each values in it, [3, 6, 10, 15] is an element. Each element can be accessed by its index. For example, we can access the value 10 with the index 2.

## Why Array is needed?

Think about we are selling used cars. We already numbered each car and we need to record the cost of each car. If we are selling just three cars, we can assign them in each variable like: 

~~~c++
int cost1 = 1000;
int cost2 = 2540;
int cost3 = 10000;
~~~

However, if we have 100 cars, we cannot assign them to different variables. In this case, we need to use an array like:

~~~c++
int costs[100] = {1000, 2540, 10000, ......};
~~~

Now, we can access the cost of a car by the car's number (index).

**The idea of an array is to represent many instances in one variable.**

The array is well known as a **static** data structure, which means once the size is given to it, it cannot be changed. ts memory is statically allocated or allocated at **compile-time**, only a fixed memory will be allocated for storage, and thus compiler is the only one that can destroy it.

### Advantages

+ Users can efficiently access to any element in an array. ($O(1)$ time complexity to access an element)
+ Arrays are a memory-efficient way of storing data. The size of the array is known at compile time since the elements of an array are stored in contiguous memory locations. This means that memory can be allocated for the entire array in one block, reducing memory fragmentation.
+ Arrays can store various data types, including complex data structures.
+ The array data structures is compatible with most hardware architectures.
+ Array data structures are used to implement the other data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.

### Disadvantages

+ Since an array has a fixed size which is determined at compile-time, make it impossible to store extra data if required. (Less memory allocation cause data loss and more memory allocation cause memory loss)
+ An array is homogeneous in nature which means a single array can store only values of same data type.
+ Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations and all the elements after the insertion or deletion point must be shifted to accommodate the change, thus deletion and insertion are very difficult to implement.

## Types of Arrays:

**One-dimensional array (1-D array)**:

![image-20231011133050120](/assets/images/1-D-array.png)

**Two-dimensional array (2-D array)**:

![image-20231011133657401](/assets/images/2-D-array.png)

**Multi-dimensional array (N-D array)**:

A multi-dimensional array can be termed as an array of arrays that stores homogeneous data in tabular form.

Data in multidimensional arrays is generally stored in row-major order in the memory.

### Difference in Types

| Basis           | One Dimensional Array                                        | Two Dimensional Array                                        | Multi Dimensional Array                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**  | Store a single list of the element of a similar data type.   | Store a list-of-lists of the elements of a similar data type. | Store a array-of-arrays of the elements of a similar data type. |
| **Declaration** | The declaration varies for different language but normally:<br />***datatype array_name[row]*** | The declaration varies for different language but normally:<br />***datatype array_name[row][col]*** | The declaration varies for different language but normally:<br />***datatype array_name[size_1][size_2]...[size_N]*** |
| **Dimension**   | One                                                          | Two                                                          | N                                                            |
| **Size(bytes)** | (size of datatype) * size of the array                       | (size of datatype) * row * col                               | (size of datatype) * size_1 * size_2 * ... * size_N          |

## Dynamic Array

You probably know that the size of the array is allocated to the compile-time, but the array can also be created as a **dynamic array**. Many people have learned that array is a static data structure. Maybe it's quite confusing, but static and dynamic data structures are terms that divide the characteristics of declared data structures, but one data structure can be declared in various ways. It is possible to allocate memory dynamically which means that the memory can be assigned during the **run time**.

## Subarray

A ***subarray*** is a contiguous part of array.

For an array of size $n$, there are $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ non-empty subarrays.

**Example**: Assume we have an array `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.

Then there are 10 subarrays:

~~~markdown
(1), (2), (3), (4)
(1,2), (2,3), (3,4)
(1,2,3), (2,3,4)
(1,2,3,4)
~~~

{: .notice--danger}

There is an useful algorithm to find the *largest sum contiguous subarray* by [**Kadane's Algorithm**](../../algorithm/kadane's-algorithm/). 

## Subsequence

A ***subsequence*** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by removing zero or more elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements.

For an array of size $n$, there are $2^{n}-1$ non-empty sub-sequences in total.

**Example**: Assume we have an array `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.

Then there are 15 subsequences:

~~~markdown
(1), (2), (3), (4)
(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4) (3,4)
(1,2,3), (1,2,4) (1,3,4), (2,3,4)
(1,2,3,4)
~~~

The difference between **subarray** and **subsequence** is that the **subarray** must be a contiguous part while **subsequence** can contain any non-repeated elements regardless their order in the original array.

## Subset

A ***subset*** is a set that its all elements belonging to other sets.

A subset is denoted as "$\subseteq$".

**Example**: Assume we have an array `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.

And if we have another set, `arr2 = [1,3]`, the $arr2 \subseteq arr$ since all elements in `arr2` are also the elements of `arr`.
