# Solution
We are going to use a ***Sliding Window*** algorithm and ***unordered_map***. Let's see some basic private variables we are going to set:

+ `n`: length of the given string, `s`.
+ `k`: number of words in the given string array, `words`.
+ `wordLength`: the length of each word in `words`.
+ `substringSize`: the total length of the concatenated string.
+ `wordCount`: the `unordered_map<string, int>` to store word in `words` and count the number of each word.

First we are going to create a helper function called `slidingWindow` which requires `int left`, `string s`, and `list<Integer> answer` as parameters. The `slidingWindow` traverse the given string `s` from the index of `left` and by increasing the index by `wordLength`. Hence we will check every `wordLength` string in `s` from `left`, i.e.,if `s = "abcdefg", wordLength = 2, left = 1`, then we check `"bc", "de", "fg"`. Thus we should call the `slidingWindow` function `wordLength` times with different `left` values from `0 <= left < wordLength`. Our main function called `findSubstring` will be:

~~~c++
vector<int> findSubstring(string s, vector<string>& words) {
    // Set the global values
    n = s.size();
    k = words.size();
    wordLength = words[0].size();
    substringSize = wordLength * k;
    for (auto word : words) wordCount[word]++;
    
    vector<int> answer;
    // Call helper function
    for (int i = 0; i < wordLength; i++) {
        slidingWindow(i, s, answer);
    }
    return answer;
}
~~~

Now we are going to implement the helper function, `slidingWindow`. The main process of this function is follows:

1. We need new ***unordered_map*** to check how many words in `words` were found in the current traverse.
2. We need two more variables, `wordsUsed` and `excessWord`,  to count the concatenated words in current traverse and to check whether there exists an excess word in the current traverse.
3. Now we traverse the `s`: `for (int right = left, right <= n - wordLength; right += wordLength)`
   1. We get the substring of `s` with the index of `[right, right + wordLength]` which represents the current word.
   2. Check if the current word exists in the given array of words, `words`.
      1. If it doesn't exist in `words`, we should restart finding the concatenated string. Hence we clear all variables: `wordsUsed = 0, excessWord = false, wordsFound.clear(), left = right + wordLength`. And we `continue`.
      2. If it exists, 
         1. we should check whether the current found concatenated string exceeds `substringSize` or there exists `excessWord`. If so, it means we cannot concatenate the concatenated string and the current word. Hence we remove the first word in the concatenated string, `s[left, left + wordLength]`.
         2. Now  we concatenate the current word to the concatenated string by `wordsFound[current_word]++`.
         3. If `wordsFound[current_word] <= wordCount[current_word]` then it means it is okay. Thus we `wordsUsed+=1`.
         4. Otherwise, it means the current word is the excess word. Thus we `excessWord = true`.
         5. if `wordsUsed == k` and `excessWord = false`, we put the `left` to the `answer`.

# Time Complexity: *$O(k + n \times wordLength)$*
First we initialize `wordCount` which consumes $O(k)$ complexity.

The `slidingWindow` traverse `s` once: $O(n)$.

We call the `slidingWindow` `wordLength` times, hence $O(n) * O(wordLength) = O(n \times wordLength)$.

The total complexity is $O(k + n \times wordLength)$.

# Space Complexity: *$O(k + wordLength)$*
We store each word in `words` to the hash map: $O(k)$.

Also, we store substrings in `sub` which requires $O(wordLength)$ space.
