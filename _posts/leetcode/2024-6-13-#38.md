This question is from the [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) and you can find the question here, [38. Count and Say](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/description/).
{: .notice--danger}

# Solution
To solve this problem, we will build recursive program that recursively find `countAndSay(n-1)` when we get an int `n`. Then our program will convert the `countAndSay(n-1)` to the new string following the rule described in the problem.

First we will set the base case: `if (n == 1) return "1";`
Initialize new variables, `preAns = countAndSay(n-1)` and `ans = ""`.
Now we iterate each character in the `preAns`, count the same characters that appear continuously and build the `ans` as required.

# C++ Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string countAndSay(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return "1";
  
        string preAns = countAndSay(n-1);
        string ans = "";
        int start = 0;
        int end = 0;
        while (end < preAns.size()) {
            while (end < preAns.size() && preAns[start] == preAns[end]) end++;
            ans += (end - start) + '0';
            ans += preAns[start];
            start = end;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

# Python Code
~~~python
class Solution(object):
    def countAndSay(self, n):
        if n == 1 : return "1"
        
        preAns = self.countAndSay(n - 1)
        ans = ""

        preChar = preAns[0]
        count = 0

        for cur in preAns:
            if cur == preChar:
                count+=1
            else:
                ans += str(count) + preChar
                preChar = cur
                count = 1
        ans += str(count) + preChar
        return ans

# Time Complexity: *$O(n^{2})$*
Our program recursively calls itself `n` times, and in each recursive call, it iterates over the previous answer to generate the new answer.

# Space Complexity: *$O(n)$*
Out program uses a recursive call stack to store intermediate results, and each recursive call creates a new string `ans`.
