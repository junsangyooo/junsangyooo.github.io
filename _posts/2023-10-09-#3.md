# Solution
We are going to use ***Sliding Window*** approach to solve this problem.

The process is:

+ Like the motion we slide window, we need $left$ point and $right$ point (in our code, each point will be an index).
+ We are going to traverse the given string $s$ as increasing $right$.
+ In loop:
  + If we have another index for the char, $s[right]$, it means the substring from $left$ index to $right$ index contains repeating characters, thus we move $left$ index to our remembered previous index  +1 ($s[right]+1$).
  + Remember the current char's index
  + find the maximum length by comparing right - left + 1 and current max

To make this solution more intuitive, let me give you an example: 

Let $s$ = "abbs" and we traverse $s$.

**First loop**: $left = 0$, $right = 0$

| s =      | a            | b    | b    | s    |
| :------- | ------------ | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| index    | 0            | 1    | 2    | 3    |
| Remember | s[0] = a = 0 |      |      |      |

$max = 1$

**Second loop**: $left = 0$, $right = 1$

| s =      | a            | b            | b    | s    |
| :------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---- | ---- |
| index    | 0            | 1            | 2    | 3    |
| Remember | s[0] = a = 0 | s[1] = b = 1 |      |      |

$max = 2$

**Third loop**: $left = 0$, $right = 2$

| s =      | a            | b            | b            | s    |
| :------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ---- |
| index    | 0            | 1            | 2            | 3    |
| Remember | s[0] = a = 0 | s[1] = b = 1 | s[2] = b = 1 |      |

We found $s[2] = b$ appeared at the index of 1. Thus now we move $left$ to $1 + 1 = 2$ Then our new string without repeating characters is just b with length of 1. Since our current $max$ is 2 and our length of the new string is 1, $max$ remains as 2.

$max = 2$

**Fourth loop**: $left = 2$, $right = 3$

| s =      | a            | b            | b            | s            |
| :------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| index    | 0            | 1            | 2            | 3            |
| Remember | s[0] = a = 0 | s[1] = b = 1 | s[2] = b = 1 | s[3] = s = 3 |

Since $right-left+1=2=max$ our max length of the substring without repeating characters is 2

**Answer: 2**

# C++ Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(std::string s) {
        std::vector<int> dict(256, -1); // Set all Characters' indexes as -1
        int left = 0, max = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) { // Traverse the string, s
            if (dict[s[i]] >= left) { // If the char, s[i], exists in our current checking string
                left = dict[s[i]] + 1;	//move 'left' to the existing previous s[i] + 1
            }
            dict[s[i]] = i;	// Remember s[i]'s index
            max = std::max(i - left + 1, max);
        }
        return max;
    }
};
```

# Python Code
~~~python
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        # In Python, we are going to remember substring itself, not an index.
        sub = ''
        output = ''
        for i in s:	# traverse the given string, s
            if i not in sub:# If i is the new char
                sub += i# We add i at the end of sub
            else:# If i is the repeating char
                if len(output) <= len(sub):# Before modifying 'sub', check sub is longer than output
                    output = sub# the longest substring is sub
                sub = sub.split(i)[-1] + i# modify sub
        return max(len(output), len(sub))
                
~~~

# Time Complexity: *O(n)*
We traverse $s$ once.

# Space Complexity: *O(min(m, n))*
Let's assume $m$ and $n$ represents the length $s$ and the number of distinct characters in $s$, respectively. We only need to use space for distinct characters.
