# What is PCCP

The PCCP (Programmers Certified Coding Professional) is a high level programming certificate for coding majors.

This certificate test is hosted by "[Programmers](https://programmers.co.kr/)", a Korean programming support organization, and 4 questions related to the language you chose among Python, Java, and C++, will be presented. The test time is 120 minutes and the certificate is valid for 2 years.

The language I chose for this contest is C++, and the scope of questions are as follows:

+ Basic Implementaion
+ Basic Data Structures and Algorithms (String, Array, Greedy, Sort, etc.)
+ Standard Data Structures and Algorithms (Sort, Stack, Queue, Deque, Hash, Binary Search, DFS, and BFS)
+ Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (Graph, Tree, Heap, and Dynamic Programming)
+ Efficiency (time and space).

In this study note, we will first solve the two mock exams and previous exam questions, then we will briefly review the data structures and algorithms in C++.
