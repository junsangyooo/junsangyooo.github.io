This question is from the [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) and you can find the question here, [12. Integer to Roman](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-roman/).
{: .notice--danger}

# Solution
Our input integer, `num`, is limited as `1 <= num <= 3999`. 

Create an array that connects each Roman character with the numbers it represents.

~~~python
numbers = [1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1]
symbols = ["M", "CM", "D", "CD", "C", "XC", "L", "XL", "X", "IX", "V", "IV", "I"]
# We can access the corresponding Roman characters by the index of the number.
~~~

~~~c++
std::vector<std::pair<int, std::string>> symbols = 
    {
        {1000, "M"}, {900, "CM"}, {500, "D"}, {400, "CD"}, {100, "C"}, {90, "XC"},
        {50, "L"}, {40, "XL"}, {10, "X"}, {9, "IX"}, {5, "V"}, {4, "IV"}, {1, "I"}
    };
// In C++, Java, etc. we can create an array for pairs <number, Roman symbol>
~~~

And we traverse the array by:

+ Get the quotient of the `num` divided by `numbers[i]`. Append the corresponding Roman characters as many as the quotient.
+ `num` is the remainder of `num` divided by `numbers[i]`.

# C++ Code
```c++
class Solution {
    std::vector<std::pair<int, std::string>> symbols = 
    {
        {1000, "M"}, {900, "CM"}, {500, "D"}, {400, "CD"}, {100, "C"}, {90, "XC"},
        {50, "L"}, {40, "XL"}, {10, "X"}, {9, "IX"}, {5, "V"}, {4, "IV"}, {1, "I"}
    };
public:
    std::string intToRoman(int num) {
        std::string answer = "";
        for (auto p: symbols) {
            int quotient = num / p.first;
            for (int i = 0; i < quotient; i++) {
                answer += p.second;
            }
            num %= p.first;
        }
        return answer;
    }
};
```

# Python Code
~~~python
class Solution(object):
    def intToRoman(self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        numbers = [1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1]
        symbols = ["M", "CM", "D", "CD", "C", "XC", "L", "XL", "X", "IX", "V", "IV", "I"]

        answer = ""
        for i, number in enumerate(numbers):
            quotient = num // number
            answer += symbols[i] * quotient
            num %= number
        return answer
~~~

# Time Complexity: *$O(1)$*
Time complexity is based on the input size. However, our loop has an upper limit on how many it can iterates. Therefore, we say the time complexity is constant.

# Space Complexity: *$O(1)$*
The amount of memory used does not change with the size of the input integer, and is therefore constant.
