# What is PCCE

The PCCE (Programmers Certified Coding Esential) is basic programming certificate for coding non-majors.

This certificate test is hosted by "[Programmers](https://programmers.co.kr/)", a Korean programming support organization, and 10 questions related to the language you chose among Python, Java, and C++, will be presented. The test time is 50 minutes and the certificate is valid for 7 years.

Although I have a minor in computing, I applied for this certificate test to prepare for PCCP(Programmers Certified Coding Professional), which is PCCE's higher level certificate. The language I chose for this contest is Python, and the scope of questions are as follows:

+ Conditional Statement
+ Loop
+ Variable
+ String
+ Operators
+ Input and Output
+ Function
+ Efficiency and use of Libraries
+ Data Structures and Algorithms

In this study note, we will study the sections above by summarizing the content provided by [Python's official Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/) and several examples:

# Compound Statements

**Compound statements** contain **conditional statements**, **loop statements**, etc.

## the `if` statement

The `if` statement is used for contidional execution:

~~~python
if_stmt ::= if assignment_expression : suite
			(elif assignment_expression : suite)
    		[else assignment_expression : suite]
~~~

**Example**:

~~~python
x = 0
if x == 0:
    print("x is 0.")
elif x == 1:
    print("x is 1.")
else:
    print("x is not 0 or 1.")
~~~

**Output**:

~~~markdown
x is 0.
~~~



In the above, `x == 0` after `if` is the assignment_expression and `print("x is 0.")` is the suite for `if`.

You should remember that `elif` and `else` don't need to appear every `if` statement.

~~~python
x = 0
if x == 0: print("x is 0.")
# This code is also allowed.
# Output: 
# x is 0.
~~~

## the `while` statement

The `while` statement is used for repeated execution as long as an expression is true:

~~~python
while_stmt ::= while assignment_expression : suite
			   [else : suite]
~~~

This repeately tests the assignment_expression and , if it is true, executes the first suite, otherwise suite of the `else` cluase, if present,  is executed and the loop terminates.

Like `elif` and `else` in `if` statement, the `else` clause is optional in`while` statement.

**Example**:

~~~python
x = 10
while (x > 0) :
    print(x)
    x = x - 1
else :
    print("Now x is 0.")
# This while statement above will print the value of x from 10 to 1 and print "Now x is 0." at the end.

# remember now x is 0
while (x  <= 10):
    print(x)
    x = x + 1
# The while statement above will print the value of x from 0 to 10 and will be terminated.
~~~

**Output**:

~~~markdown
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
Now x is 0.
0

~~~



## the `for` statement

The `for` statement is used to iterate over the elements of a sequence or other iterable object:

~~~python
for_stmt ::= for target_list in starred_list : suite
			 [else : suite]
~~~

The `starred_list` expression is evaluated once (it should be an iterable object). The loop will iterate the `starred_list` and for every item provided by the iterator, the suite will be executed. When the iterator is exhausted, the suite in the `else` clause, if present, is executed and the loop terminates.

**Example**:

~~~python
starred_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
for num in starred_list:
    print(num)
~~~

**Output**:

~~~markdown
1
2
3
4
5
~~~

## `zip()`

Iterate over several iterables in parallel, producing tuples with an item from each one.

~~~python
for item in zip([1,2,3], ['bad', 'good', 'soso']):
    print(item)
# Output:
# (1, 'bad')
# (2, 'good')
# (3, 'soso')

for number, feeling in zip([1,2,3], ['bad', 'good', 'soso']):
    print("Number: %d and the feeling is %s" % (number, feeling))
# Output:
# Number: 1 and the feeling is bad
# Number: 2 and the feeling is good
# Number: 3 and the feeling is soso
~~~



## the `break` and `continue` statement

The `break` statement immediately terminates the current innermost loop:

~~~python
break_stmt ::= break
~~~

**Example**:

~~~python
l = [1,2,3,4]
i = 0
for i in l:
    # if i becomes 3, the for loop will be terminated
    if i == 3: break
    print(i)
print("The current i value is: " + i)
~~~

**Output**:

~~~markdown
1
2
The current i value is 3
~~~

You can see that the `i` value keeps its current value after the `break`.

The `continue` statement continues with the next cycle of the nearest enclosing loop.

~~~python
continue_stmt ::= continue
~~~

**Example**:

~~~python
l = [1,2,3,4]
i = 0
for i in l:
    # if i becomes 3, the for loop jumps to the next cycle
    if i == 3: continue
    print(i)
~~~

**Output**:

~~~markdown
1
2
4
~~~

## `Range()`

The useful built-in type `range()` represents immutable arithmetic sequences of integers.

~~~python
range ::= range(start, stop, step)
~~~

The `start` and `step` parts are optional and the default values are 0 and 1 respectively.

`range()` iterates integers in [start, stop) by step (1 by default).

**Example**:

~~~python
print("#One")
for i in range(1,5,1):	# 1 2 3 4
    print(i)

print("#Two")
for i in range(3):	# 0 1 2
    print(i)

print("#Three")
for i in range(10, 5, -1): # 10 9 8 7 6
    print(i)
    
print("#Four")
for i in range(4, 6):	# 4 5
    print(i)
    
print("#Five")
for i in range(10, 0):	#
    print(i)
~~~

**Output**:

~~~markdown
#One
1
2
3
4
#Two
0
1
2
#Three
10
9
8
7
6
#Four

6
#Five
~~~

# Variables

Python is a **dynamically typed language** which means user doesn't need to specify the data type when creating a variable.

+ integer: 2, 5,  -3
+ float: 2.0, 5.0, -3.0
+ string: "Hello, World"

When we assign a value to a variable, Python specify the data type of the variable for us.

~~~python
x = 5 # Integer
y = 4.0 # Float
z = "2023" # String
r = 'Hello' # String
~~~

There are some rules to set the name of variables:

1. First character must be a letter or the underscore character

   ~~~python
   1num = 4 # causes an error
   ~~~

2. Only can contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _)

3. Variable names are case-sensitive

   ~~~python
   num = 1
   Num = 2
   print(num)
   print(Num)
   
   # Output:
   # 1
   # 2
   ~~~

4. A variable name cannot by any of the [Python keywords](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp).

# List

A list can be written as a list of comma-separated values between square brackets.

2-D and Multi-D lists can be written as the same way.

~~~python
numbers = [1, 4, -1, 65]
twoD = [['a','b','c'], ['d','e','f']]
print(numbers)
print(twoD)
# Output:
# [1, 4, -1, 65]
# [['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d', 'e', 'f']]
~~~

Lists can be indexed and sliced:

~~~python
numbers = [1, 4, -1, 65]
twoD = [['a','b','c'], ['d','e','f']]
print(numbers[0])	# print the first element of numbers
print(numbers[-1])	# print the last element of numbers
print(numbers[-2:]) # print the last two elements of numbers as a list
print(numbers[:]) # print a new list containing all the elements of numbers

print(twoD[1][0]) # print the first element of the second element in twoD
# Output:
# 1
# 65
# [-1, 65]
# [1, 4, -1, 65]
# d
~~~

Lists are mutable type which means that it is possible to change their content. Lists support concatenation with `'+'` and if we want to add a new item at the end of the list, we can use `append()` method.

~~~python
numbers = [1,2,3,4]
numbers += [5, 6, 7, 9]
print(numbers)
numbers[-1] = 8	# Change the last element to 0
print(numbers)
numbers.append(9) # Add 9 at the end of the list
# Output:
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
~~~

The built-in function `len()` returns the length of a list:

~~~python
l = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
print(len(l))
# Output:
# 5
~~~

The list can be initialized using `'*'`.

~~~python
oneD = [0] * 3
twoD = [[1] * 2] * 3
print(oneD)
print(twoD)
# Output:
# [0, 0, 0]
# [[1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]]
~~~

We can initialize a list using loops (but the loop should be inside of the square bracket):

~~~python
oneD = [0 for i in range(5)]
twoD = [[1] * 4 for j in range(3)]
print(oneD)
print(twoD)
# Output:
# [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
# [[1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1]]
~~~






# String

Strings can be enclosed in single quotes or double quotes. And to quote a quote, we need to "escape" it, by preceding it with`\` or by using other type of quotation marks.

~~~python
str1 = 'Hello'
str2 = "Hello"
print (str1 == str2)

print('This is Jun\'s Study Note.')
print("This is Jun's Study Note.")
# Output:
# True
# This is Jun's Study Note.
# This is Jun's Study Note.
~~~

If we want a new line, we need to add `\n`.

~~~python
str3 = "Hello, World!\nI am Jun."
print(str3)
# Output:
# Hello, World!
# I am Jun.
~~~

If you don't want characters prefaced by `\` to be interpreted as special characters, you just need to add `r` before the first quote.

~~~python
s1 = "C:\some\name"	# \n creates a new line
s2 = r"C:\some\name"
print(s1)
print(s2)
# Output:
# C:\some
# ame
# C:\some\name
~~~

The triple-quotes: `"""..."""` or `'''...'''` creates a string literal which can span multiple lines. In this literal, end of lines are automatically included in the string, but it's possible to prevent by adding `\` at the end fo the line.

~~~python
s = """\
Hello, World!
This is Jun's Study Note.
:)"""	# The new line on the first line was prevented
print(s)
# Output:
# Hello, World!
# This is Jun's Study Note.
# :)
~~~

Strings can be concatenated and repeated by `+` and `*`. 

Two or more string literals next to each other are automatically concatenated. But this only works with two literals though, not with variables or expressions.

~~~python
s = "Jun"
s1 = s + s
s2 = s * 3
s3 = "I am" ' Jun'
print(s1)
print(s2)
print(s3)
# Output:
# JunJun
# JunJunJun
# I am Jun

s4 = s s1
print(s4)
# SyntaxError: invalid syntax

s5 = (s * 4) '!'
print(s5)
# SyntaxError: invalid syntax
~~~

Putting several string within parentheses let them joined together.

~~~python
s = ("Hello, World!!"
    'I am Jun.')
print(s)
# Output:
# Hello, World!!I am Jun.
~~~

Unlike other languages, Python doesn't have a data type, character. A character is simply a string of size 1.

Strings can be indexed with the first character having index 0. Indices may also be negative numbers (start from -1), to start counting from the right.

~~~python
s = "I hate PCCE!"
print(s[0])
print(s[3])
print(s[-1])
print(s[-5])
# Output:
# I
# a
# !
# P
~~~

Strings in Python also supports *slicing*. 

~~~python
# Syntax is word[start:end] while start is included and end is excluded
# There are default values for start and end
word="Hello, World!"
print(word[1:4]) # word[1] + word[2] + word[3]
print(word[:5]) # characters from the beginning to the word[5] (excluded)
print(word[3:]) # characters from word[3] (included) to the end
print(word[-3:]) # characters from the third-last(included) to the end
print(word[:2] + word[2:]) # same as the original word
print(word[:]) # same as the original word
# Output:
# ell
# Hello
# lo, World!
# ld!
# Hello, World!
# Hello, World!

# Out of range slice indexes are handled gracefully
print(word[3:100])	# same as print(word[3:])
print(word[100:]) # Nothing printed
# Output:
# lo, World!
# 
~~~

Python strings are immutable which means they cannot be changed.

~~~python
word="Jun's Study Note."
word[-1] = '!'
# TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
#     word[-1] = '!'
~~~

If we need to need a different string, we should create a new one.

~~~python
word="Jun's Study Note."
new_word = word[:-1] + '!'
print(new_word)
# Output:
# Jun's Study Note!
~~~

The built-in function `len()` returns the length of a string:

~~~python
s="ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
l = len(s)
print(l)
# Output:
# 25
~~~

##  String Formatting

There are two ways to format a string:

+ using `%` operator and
+ using `format()` method.

### Formatting using `%`

If we put `%` after the string literal and add another value after the `%`, the value is included in the string. In this case, you can specify the place where the value will be added by putting the ***format specification string*** starting with the `%` sign at the corresponding place in the string.

**Format Specifiation String**:

+ `%s`: string literal
+ `%d`: integer
+ `%f`: float

**Example**:

~~~python
s1 = "Hello, %s!" % "World"
print(s1)
s2 = "Hello, %s!"
print(s2 % "World")
s3 = "I am %d years old."
print(s3 % 20)
s4 = "My height is %fcm."
s5 = s4 % 182.3
print(s5)
# Output:
# Hello, World!
# Hello, World!
# I am 20 years old.
# My height is 182.300000cm.
~~~

Multiple format specification strings are allowed and the values should be enclosed by a bracket.

~~~python
s = """Hello, %s!
My name is %s.
I am %d years old and %fcm tall.""" % ("World", "Jun", 20, 182.3)
print(s)
# Output:
# Hello, World!
# My name is Jun.
# I am 20 years old and 182.300000cm tall.
~~~

A formatting string may have several numerical arguments. The integer that follows the `%` symbol means the length of scope of space that the value occupies when printed. If the length of the space is greater than the value to be printed, the value is sent back when the integer is positive. Otherwise, the value is sent forward and the space is filled back. If a number with a decimal point comes after the `%` symbol, the number behind the dot means the number of decimals to be printed.

+ `%20s`: string literals which take 20 spaces (value sent backward)
+ `%-10d`: integer which takes 10 spaces (value sent forward and the left space is filled back)
+ `%.5f`: float which shows to 5 decimal points

~~~python
s1 = "%10s" % '!'
print(s1)
s2 = "%-10s" % '!'
print (s2)
s3 = "-10d + 125" % 10
print(s3)
s4 = "pi = %.5f" % 3.14159265359
print(s4)
n1 = 3.14159265359
print("%10.5f" % n1)
# Output:
#          !
# !         
# 10         + 125
# pi = 3.14159
#    3.14159
~~~

### Formatting using `format()`

~~~python
format(value, format_spec='')
format(value1, value2, ...)
# One or more values that hsould be formatted and inserted in the string.
~~~

Use the `{}` symble instead of the format specification string that starts with a `%` symbol. Also, there is no need to specify the data type. When you want to output `{` character in a string, use the character `{` twice.

~~~python
s1 = "My name is {}.".format("Jun")
print(s1)
# Output:
# My name is Jun.
~~~

You can also put an index inside of the `{}` symbol to specifies the order of the values. The first value is `{0}` and the subsequent value is `{1}`. Using this method, you can change the order of values or print the same value multiple times.

If multiple `{}`s are used and no ordered numbers are specified, they are shown in order.

~~~python
s1 = "{1}{2}{2}, {0} to meet you!".format("nice", "Ha", "ha")
print(s1)
s2 = "Jun: {}, Jason: {}, Hayden: {}"
print(s2.format(90, 100, 50))
# Output:
# Hahaha, nice to meet you!
# Jun: 90, Jason: 100, Hayden: 50
~~~

When specifying the size of spaces in the format scheme or the number below the decimal point of the floating point, put the `:` symbol in `{}` followed by the advanced formatting string. The number after `:` means the size of thes space. `<` puts the value forward and puts the space backward. Conversely, `>` puts the value backward and puts the space forward. Use `.`, numbers, and `f` characters to specify the digits of a decimal point. When the `,` symbol is inserted, a comma is attached to each thousand units.

+ `{:>10}`: literal which takes 10 spaces (value sent backward)
+ `{:<5}`: literal which takes 5 spaces (value sent forward)
+ `{:^10}`: literal which takes 10 spaces (value sent middle and spaces are separated)
+ `{:.5f}`: float which shows to 5 decimal points
+ `{:,}`: comma is attached to each thousand units.

~~~python
s1 = "[{:<20}]".format(".")
s2 = "[{:>20}]".format(".")
s3 = "[{:^20}]".format(".")
s4 = "[{:10.4f}]".format(3.14159265359)
s5 = "[{:<20,}]".format(12038901724)
print(s1)
print(s2)
print(s3)
print(s4)
print(s5)
# Output:
# [.                   ]
# [                   .]
# [         .          ]
# [    3.1416]
# [12,038,901,724      ]
~~~

If write a string before the `>`,`<`, or `^`symbol, it fills in the space with that string.

~~~python
s1 = "[{:~<20}]".format("!")
s2 = "[{:~>20}]".format("!")
s3 = "[{:~^20}]".format("!")
print(s1)
print(s2)
print(s3)
# Output:
# [!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~]
# [~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!]
# [~~~~~~~~~!~~~~~~~~~~]
~~~

## Change the case of string

`swapcase()`

Return a copy of the string with uppercase characters converted to lowercase and vice versa.

~~~python
s = "Hello, World!"
s.swapcase()
print(s)
print(s.swapcase())
print(s.swapcase().swapcase())
# Output:
# Hello, World!
# hELLO, wORLD!
# Hello, World!
~~~

`title()`

Return a titlecased version of the string where words start with an uppercase character and the remaining characters are lowercase.

~~~python
s = "I am Jun."
s.title()
print(s)
print(s.title())
# Output:
# I am Jun.
# I Am Jun.
~~~

`upper()`

Return a copy of the string with all the cased characters converted to uppercase.

~~~python
s = "Hello, World!"
s.upper()
print(s)
print(s.upper())
# Output:
# Hello, World!
# HELLO, WORLD!
~~~

`isupper()`

Return `True` if all cased characters in the string are uppercase and there is at least one cased character, `False` otherwise.

~~~python
s = "Hello, World!"
print(s.isupper())
print(s.upper().isupper())
# Output:
# False
# True
~~~

`lower()`

Return a copy of the string with all the cased characters converted to lowercase.

~~~python
s = "Hello, World!"
s.lower()
print(s)
print(s.lower())
# Output:
# Hello, World!
# hello, world!
~~~

`islower()`

Return `True` if all cased characters in the string are lowercase and there is at least one cased character, `False` otherwise.

~~~python
s = "Hello, World!"
print(s.islower())
print(s.lower().islower())
# Output:
# False
# True
~~~

`isdigit()`

Return `True` if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one character, `False` otherwise.

~~~python
s1 = "1293486"
s2 = "2134asdf"
s3 = "123.123"
print(s1.isdigit())
print(s2.isdigit())
print(s3.isdigit())
# Output:
# True
# False
# False
~~~

# Operators

## Arithmetic Operators

+ `+`: add
+ `-`: subtract
+ `*`: times
+ `**`: power
+ `\`: divide (always return a floating point number)
+ `\\`: divide (floor division discards the fractional part)
+ `%`: modulo (returns the remainder of the division)

## Logical Operators

+ `and`
+ `or`
+ `not`

| a     | b     | a and b | a or b | not a |
| ----- | ----- | ------- | ------ | ----- |
| True  | True  | True    | True   | False |
| True  | False | False   | True   | False |
| False | True  | False   | True   | True  |
| False | False | False   | False  | True  |

## Assignment Operator

+ `=`: assign the value
+ `+=`: assign the result of adding a value to a variable
+ `-=`: assign the result of subtracting a value from a variable
+ `*=`: assign the result of multiplying a variable by a value
+ `/=`: assign the result of dividing the value to the variable
+ `%=`: assign the remainder of the variable divided by the value
+ `//=`: assign a floor division of a variable divided by a value
+ `**=`: assign the result of squaring a variable by a value

# Input and output

`input(prompt)`

If the prompt argument is present, it is written to standard output without a trailing newline. The function then reads a line from `input`, converts to a string, and returns that string. When `EOF` is read, `EOFError` is raised.

~~~python
s = input('input: ')
# If the use entered "input: Hello, World!"
print(s)
# Output:
# Hello, World!
~~~

`print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=None, flush=False)`

Print `objects` to the text stream `file`, separated by `sep` and followed by `end`. `sep`,`end`,`file`, and `flush`, if present, must be given as keyword arguments.

~~~python
s = "IAMJUN"
print(s, end=' ')
# Output:
# IAMJUN
~~~

# Function

The structure of a function in Python

~~~python
def name_of_function(argument):
    ...
    ...
~~~



## Defining Functions

Let me create a function that gets two integer inputs and return the sum of them

~~~python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(1, 4))
# Output:
# 5
~~~

If we want a function which doesn't get any arguments as a parameter, we can define as follow:

~~~python
def input_and_output():
    s = input()
    print(s)
~~~

Then what if we are not sure how many arguments the function will get?

~~~python
def add(*args):
    result = 0
    for i in args:
        result += i
    return result

print(add(1, 4, 65, 4, 2))
# Output:
# 76
~~~

If we want to set a default value for a parameter we can assign the default value when defining a function. But the parameters with default values always have to be written after other parameters which don't have default values.

~~~python
def add(a, b = 10):
    return a + b
print(add(1))
# Output:
# 11
~~~



## Function Call

If I have two functions:

~~~python
def add_and_multiple(a, b):
    return a+b, a*b

def main():
    x, y = add_and_multiple(1, 5)
    a, b = add_and_multiple(3, 2)
    print("sum: %d, product: %d" % (x + a, y*b))
    
# Output:
# sum: 11, product: 30

# Efficiency and use of Libraries

Since there are too many different libraries in Python, we will only focus on `Math`, `Rand`, and `Time` libraries.

## `Math` library

This module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard.

`math.ceil(x)`

Return the ceiling of `x`, the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x`. If `x` is not a float, delegates to x which should return an integer value.

`math.comb(n, k)`

Return the number of ways to choose `k` items from `n` items without repetition and without order. Return `n! / (k! * (n - k)!)` when `k <= n` and evaluates to zero when `k > n`.

`math.fabs(x)`

Return `n` factorial as an integer.

`math.factorial(n)`

return `n` factorial as an integer.

`math.floor(x)`

Return the floor of `x`, the largest integer less than or equal to x.

`math.gcd(*integers)`

Return greatest common divisor of the specified integer arguments.

`math.isfinite(x)`

Return `True` if `x` is neither an infinity nor a NaN, and `False` otherwise.

`math.isqrt(n)`

Return the integer square root of the nonnegative integer n.

`math.perm(n ,k=none)`

Return the number of ways to choose`k` items from `n` items without repetition and with order.

`math.exp(x)`

Return `e` raised to the power `x`, where `e=2.718281...` is the base of natural logarithms.

`math.exp2(x)`

Return 2 raised to the power `x`.

`math.log(x, base)`

Return the logarithm of `x` to the given `base`, calculated as `log(x)/log(base)`

`math.sqrt(x)`

Return the square root of x.

## `random` library

This module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions.

`random.seed(a=None, version=2)`

Initialize the random number generator.

`random.getstate()`

Return an object capturing the current internal state of the generator.

`random.setstate(state)`

*state* should have been obtained from a previous call to `getstate()` and `setstate()` restores the internal state of the generator to what it was at the time `getstate()` was called.

`random.randbytes(n)`

Generate *n* random bytes.

`random.randrange(start, stop, end)`

Return a randomly selected element from `range(start, stop, step)`

`random.randint(a, b)`

Return a random integer *N* such that `a <= N <= b`.

`random.random()`

Return the next random floating point number in the range `0.0 <= X < 1.0`

## `time` library

This module provides various time-related functions. For related functionality, see also the `datetime` and `calendar` modules.

The *epoch* is the point where the time starts, the return value of `time.gmtime(0)`. It is January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC) on all platforms.

`time.time()`

Return the time in seconds since the epoch as a floating point number.
