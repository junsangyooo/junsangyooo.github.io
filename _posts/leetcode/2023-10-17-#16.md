This question is from the [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) and you can find the question here, [16. 3Sum Closest](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/).
{: .notice--danger}

# Solution
It is similar question to the [**#15. 3Sum**](15). We are going to use ***two pointers***.

+ Like [**3Sum**](/15/), we are going to sort the array first. 
+ Iterate the sorted array to fix a number.
+ If we have a fixed number, we create two pointers, `i+1` and `array_size - 1`.
+ Then we can get the difference between the sum of these three numbers and the target.
+ Compare the difference and the difference that we found before.
  + If the current difference is smaller than the previous difference, we store the current difference.
+ Then we keep narrowing the two-pointers and repeat the steps above.

# C++ Code
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int threeSumClosest(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int diff = INT_MAX;
        int n = nums.size();
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        for (int i = 0; i < n && diff != 0; i++) {
            int left = i + 1;
            int right = n - 1;
            while (left < right) {
                int sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];
                if (sum == target) return sum;
                if (abs(target - sum) < abs(diff)) {
                    diff = target - sum;
                }
                if (sum < target) left++;
                else right--;
            }
        }
        return target - diff;
    }
};
```

# Python Code
~~~python
class Solution(object):
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        diff = float('inf')
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
            while left < right:
                sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
                if sum == target: return sum
                if abs(target - sum) < abs(diff):
                    diff = target - sum
                if sum < target:
                    left += 1
                else:
                    right -= 1
            if diff == 0: return target
        return target - diff

# Time Complexity: *$O(n^{2})$*
The time complexity of sorting an array is ***$O(n log(n))$*** and the other process takes ***$O(n^{2})$***. Hence the overall complexity is ***$O(n log(n) + n^{2})$***. This is asymptotically equivalent to ***$O(n^{2})$***.

# Space Complexity: *$O(log(n)) \sim O(n)$*

The space complexity depends on the implementation of the `sort` algorithm. And the space complexity ignores the space required for the output.
