This question is from the [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) and you can find the question here, [2. Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/).
{: .notice--danger}

# Solution
Like how we normally add two numbers, we are going to sum the least-significant digits, which are the head of $l1$ and $l2$. Luckily, the given linked lists, $l1$ and $l2$, are in reverse order. 

For beginners, I think the most difficult-to-understand part of this problem is to understand the pointer. We are not looking for an answer as a number, but we need to put the answer to the ***Linked List*** following the same rule of $l1$ and $l2$, **reverse order**. Thus we need another pointer to point the head of our answer so that we can return the head of our answer even after we traverse our answer's ListNode.  For more explanation, please read the example process below.

For example:

$l1 = 5 \to 6 \to 7$

$l2 = 6 \to 3 \to 9$

$sum = 765 + 936 = 1401$

$answer = 1 \to 0 \to 4 \to 1$

Our process will be:

+ Create a pointer of a new ListNode, 'head'.
+ Create a pointer, tail, to point the 'head'.
+ Initialize a variable $leftOver$ to remember the leftover digit.
+ Now we traverse the $l1$ and $l2$ until both lists reached to the end and $leftOver$ is equal to $0$.
  + Add $l1.val$, $l2.val$, and $leftOver$, and store the sum to a variable $sum$.
  + If $sum$ is over $10$, we remember the leftover number 1(if $sum > 10$, leftover is always 1 since any sum of two one-digit numbers + 1 cannot exceed 19) for the next node.
  +  Create a newNode with its value, the first-digit number of $sum$.
  + Connect our newNode to tail.next and make tail to point a newNode.
  + Make $l1$ and $l2$ to point $l1$'s next and $l2$'s next respectively.
+ After traverse all lists, if there is a leftover number, add it to the tail
+ Return head's next

# Time Complexity: *O(max(m, n))*
Assume that m represents the length of l1 and n represents the length of l2.
Our program traverse both in the same time at most max(m, n) times.

# Space Complexity: *O(1)*
We allocate the memory max(m, n) + 1 to our answer, but we don't count the answer as part of the space complexity.
