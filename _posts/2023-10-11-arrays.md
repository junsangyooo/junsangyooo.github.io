# What is Array?
An **array** is a collection of items of same data types stored at contiguous memory locations.
{: .notice--info}

These are three key-words need to know:
+ Array Index: In an array, elements are identified by their indexes (starts from 0).
+ Array Elemement: Elements are items stored in an array.
+ Array Length: The length of the array is determined by the maximum number of elements it can contain.

The Array looks like:

| Array | 3    | 6    | 10   | 15   |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Index | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    |

The array above has the length of 4 and each values in it, [3, 6, 10, 15] is an element. Each element can be accessed by its index. For example, we can access the value 10 with the index 2.

The array is well known as a **static** data structure, which means once the size is given to it, it cannot be changed. It has a pros and cons but you can find it on [Data Structure Study Note](../data-structure/)

The array is the basic data structure which you must know before to learn other data structures such as *stack*, *queue*, and *linked lists*.
